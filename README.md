MY CAPSTONE PROJECT


FIRETHREADS is a custom e-commerce app built using boostrap, react, atomize & the shopify & forever 21 api's. 
The target audience of my website are men & the products sold will be Menâ€™s clothes & sneakers. 
It will be a simple site with little glitter & all functionality. 
I will be using React Native to accomplish my front & back-end goals. 
My design will be simple & similar to that of sites like Etsy, Poshmark, Asos or Amazon.
