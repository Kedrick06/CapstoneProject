FIRETHREADS is a custom e-commerce app built using boostrap, react, and the shopify and forever 21 api's. 
The target audience of my website are men and the products sold will be Menâ€™s clothes and sneakers. 
It will be a simple site with little glitter and all functionality. 
I will be using React Native to accomplish my front and back-end goals. 
My design will be simple and similar to that of sites like Etsy, Poshmark, Asos or Amazon.
