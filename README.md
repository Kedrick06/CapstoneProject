FIRETHREADS is a custom e-commerce app built using boostrap, react, and the shopify and forever 21 api's.The target audience of my website are men and the products sold will be Men’s clothes and sneakers. It will be a simple site with little glitter and all functionality. I will be using React Native to accomplish my front and back-end goals. I’ll be researching the best API’s to use over the weekend, but I shouldn’t have any problem finding good data.My design will be simple and similar to that of sites like Etsy, Poshmark, Asos or Amazon.
